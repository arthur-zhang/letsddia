# DDIA-BookBytes

This repository contains code implementations for 'Designing Data-Intensive Applications (DDIA)' by Martin Kleppmann in Rust, Go, and Java. The project aims to provide practical examples and hands-on exercises based on the concepts and principles discussed in the book, showcasing solutions in multiple programming languages. It serves as a valuable companion for those who want to delve deeper into the world of designing and building scalable and maintainable data-intensive applications across different language ecosystems.
